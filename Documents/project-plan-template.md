## Project Contents

### Introduction

You are a vampire hunter, who freshly got turned into a vampire. 
Being a vampire isn’t going to stop you from killing other vampires, merely it’s an improvement over your previous situation. 
Explore your new abilities as you take down hordes of vampires, hellbent on killing you, an abomination. 
The world is dark and gloomy, and you must grapple with your new reality. Is there any escape or are you forever doomed to be the monster you swore to destroy?

In Exsanguination, you play as a former vampire slayer turned vampire, battling hordes of undead in a fast-paced, first-person melee combat experience.
Armed with gadgets from your old life, you'll need to kill swiftly—or be killed even faster.
The game focuses on high-intensity, brutal action where survival depends on your speed and skill.
