# Revenue Analysis for Game Project: Estimating Potential Success Based on Comparable Products
This report provides a detailed analysis of the potential revenue our game could generate by comparing it with similar first-person games, specifically focusing on the Doom franchise. By evaluating historical sales and revenue data of the Doom series, we will make educated estimates about the possible financial outcomes for our own game.

# Comparable Products: The Doom Franchise
The Doom series is one of the most iconic and successful first-person shooter franchises. It spans several decades, and each title in the series has achieved varying levels of success, largely due to changing market conditions, technological advancements, and the evolution of player expectations. We will examine the sales and revenue figures for key titles in the Doom series to assess trends and project potential outcomes for our game.

## 1. The Original Doom (1993)
The original Doom revolutionized the FPS genre when it was released in 1993. Widely considered one of the most influential video games in history, it pioneered online multiplayer and modding communities, contributing to its long-lasting success.

Total Units Sold: 3.5 million copies (physical and digital)
Revenue Generated: $2.7 million (adjusted for inflation and accounting for its shareware model)
Though the revenue generated by the original Doom seems low by modern standards, it's important to note that this was during a time when digital distribution platforms did not exist, and the game was initially distributed via a shareware model, which greatly limited revenue generation through direct sales.

## 2. Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994)
Doom II, released just a year after the original, was an immediate commercial success. Building on the strong foundation of its predecessor, it introduced new levels, weapons, and enemies, retaining the core audience while attracting new players.

Total Units Sold: 2 million copies
Revenue Generated: $2.7 million
Doom II benefited from the continued success of the original Doom and its established fanbase. The consistency in revenue, despite fewer copies sold compared to Doom, highlights the evolving market for FPS games during the mid-90s.

## 3. Doom 3 (2004)
A decade later, Doom 3 was released in 2004, with advanced graphics, improved mechanics, and a darker, more narrative-driven approach. It marked a significant departure from the fast-paced, arena-style combat of the earlier games.

Total Units Sold: 3.5 million copies
Revenue Generated: $1.4 million
While Doom 3 sold the same number of copies as the original Doom, its revenue was lower due to a combination of development costs, higher production expenses, and changes in the game industry. This highlights how the financial structure of the industry had shifted, making profitability more challenging despite strong sales.

## 4. Doom (2016)
The reboot of the franchise in 2016, simply titled Doom, marked a return to fast-paced, visceral combat, with modern enhancements in graphics and gameplay. Its success was largely due to its nostalgic appeal combined with updated mechanics that catered to modern audiences.

Total Units Sold: 5.5 million copies
Revenue Generated: $133.5 million
The massive increase in revenue reflects the shift in how games are monetized in the digital age. With the rise of digital distribution platforms such as Steam, and the inclusion of downloadable content (DLC) and post-launch support, Doom (2016) was able to capitalize on more direct sales to consumers, minimizing distribution costs and maximizing profit.

## 5. Doom Eternal (2020)
Doom Eternal built upon the success of Doom (2016), refining the combat and introducing even more varied gameplay. Released in 2020, it launched to widespread critical acclaim and was able to reach a vast audience through digital platforms, including additional DLC.

Total Units Sold: 5.1 million copies
Revenue Generated: $190.2 million
Doom Eternal's success can be attributed to not only strong sales but also its aggressive marketing, digital sales strategies, and additional revenue streams from DLC and expansion packs. It showcases the evolving revenue model for modern AAA titles, where post-launch content plays a significant role in driving long-term profitability.

# Revenue Projection for Our Game: 'Exsanguination'
Using the historical performance of the Doom franchise as a benchmark, we can estimate potential revenue for our own game, Exsanguination, a fast-paced, melee-based first-person game set in a dark, vampire-infested world. Given the similarities in gameplay intensity and the audience appeal of fast-paced, action-packed shooters, our estimates will take into account market trends, pricing models, and potential unit sales.

# Key Factors in Our Estimate:
Target Audience: Similar to Doom’s audience, we are aiming at fans of fast-paced, high-intensity action games. However, our focus on melee combat and a unique vampire theme may attract both FPS fans and those looking for something different.
Platform Reach: Doom games benefit from multi-platform releases (PC, consoles), which we plan to emulate. Digital distribution on platforms like Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation is crucial.
Monetization Strategy: We can adopt similar post-launch monetization strategies through downloadable content (DLC) or expansions to extend our game's revenue potential.
Marketing & Hype: Given the success of Doom’s marketing campaigns, building strong pre-launch momentum will be key to achieving high day-one sales.
Estimated Units Sold:
Considering the success of Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal, we can reasonably expect our game to sell 2-3 million copies within the first year, provided we successfully execute our marketing and distribution strategy.

# Projected Revenue:
If we price our game at $40-$50, which is typical for similar titles, and factor in potential DLC, we estimate:

# Base Game Revenue:
2 million copies × $45 average = $90 million
3 million copies × $45 average = $135 million
Given the varying performance of similar games, a conservative estimate would suggest a gross revenue of $67 million for the base game alone. This does not include potential revenue from DLC, expansions, or merchandise, which could further boost profitability.

# Conclusion
By analyzing the sales figures and revenue of past Doom titles, we can establish a realistic estimate for the potential success of Exsanguination. While historical trends in the first-person genre show significant growth, leveraging modern distribution channels and post-launch content will be key to maximizing our revenue. Based on our estimations, our game could generate around $67 million in gross revenue, with room for growth depending on the success of additional content.
